```
As a visionary and adventure seeker,
I want to be able to view and add different destinations throughout the world,
So that I can organize and plan my future trips accordingly
```


## Purpose
* The ability to store user information, validate user through OAuth verification, and ability to store and book itinerary for later retrieval.
* Using datastorage such as mySql allows for convenient usage and storage of users data, along with increased security protection through using tools such as the library ***bcrypt***.
* Having a simple two page website with a dynamic interface allows for dense, yet user friendly navigation that maximizes usage for all.
* Storing users data adds gateway for further additions, such as Machine Learning and data prediction to start giving predictions on which locations the user will want to visit next.

## Learning Experiences
* Creating a complete full-stack application that implements GET and POST routes to save and retrieve information from the database, and rendering of server side templating engine, such as handlebars, to process, filter, and display data for user interaction.
* Usage of Travis.yml & eslint to filter, clean, and test code for inconsistencies or errors.
* OAuth to maximize security on website and to scrape as much user data, while simultaneously further linking the web through third party verification means.
* Used various forms of middlewear on backend to filter and sort data to further enhance validity of data stored.
* Deploying multifaceted website with dense schemas to heroku.

## Future Possibilities
* Host third-party links to advertise to user to earn royalty off sale of goods. 
    - Implement additional means of advertisements to enhance revenues of published website.
* Use concepts of Machine Learning to find trends in users desirability of locations to push specials and upcoming events.
* Ability to create simple blog form or in-house reviews of different event and locations that the website houses to push to the mass based off **whats trending**.
